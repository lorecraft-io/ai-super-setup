# Copywriting carve-out — full reference

**Principle:** the concise skill suspends when the deliverable will be read by a human audience, not by Nate-as-operator. If the output's purpose is to land with people (persuade, entertain, inform, convert, narrate), it's copywriting.

## Trigger surfaces (illustrative, not exhaustive)

**Social & short-form:**
- Tweet, X post, LinkedIn post, thread, Reddit post, Discord post, Telegram broadcast
- TikTok / Reels / Shorts captions and hooks

**Video & audio:**
- Video script, voice-over, podcast intro/outro, YouTube description
- Hook, beat sheet, scene description

**Marketing surfaces:**
- Headline, subheadline, tagline, subject line, CTA, push notification
- Cold email, warm intro email, DM copy, follow-up template
- Landing-page copy, hero section, feature blurb, pricing-page copy, FAQ entry
- Ad copy, billboard, banner, app-store description, product description

**Long-form content:**
- Blog posts, essays, op-eds
- Creative writing (fiction, poetry, narrative)
- README humor pass, marketing-facing GitHub readme prose (not technical sections)
- Content-ideas entries, video idea drafts, post idea drafts

**Business / client:**
- Pitch deck slides, investor memo, one-pager, proposal, SOW prose, case-study writeup
- Client-facing report prose, executive summary, board update
- Brand voice work, naming exercises, product names, company names
- About-page bio, founder bio, team bio, profile copy

**Voice-shape requests:**
- "Make it sound more X", "tighten this prose", "rewrite this paragraph"
- "Punch this up", "make it pop", "sharpen the hook"

**Length-as-constraint:**
- "In 280 chars", "one-liner", "two sentences for the homepage"

**Project-bound deliverables (any output for these surfaces is copywriting by default):**
LORECRAFT-HQ (client work, pitches, proposals, decks), FIDGETCODING (scripts, content, branding), LAVA-NET (posts, drafts, scripts), PARZVL (creative work, campaigns), CART-BLANCHE-HQ, BLOOM-HQ, PEAKS-AND-PAUSES, PALM-AVE, WAGMI, BLUE-GUM, POETRY, 7XWORLD.

**Internal team comms with voice:**
Announcements, hype posts, kickoffs.

## What changes in copy mode

- Length follows the format, not the concise budgets.
- Voice carries — rhetorical hedging, punchier sentence structure, beat-driven cadence allowed.
- Formatting follows the deliverable (script beats, headline cadence, three-line stanzas, etc.).
- The end-of-turn recap rule suspends — copy ends when copy ends.
- Dry-wit + profanity limits relax to match the deliverable's voice.

## What still applies in copy mode

- Never "Nathan" in any output.
- No `Co-Authored-By: claude-flow <ruv@ruv.net>` in commits.
- No identity jokes (Jewish/sobriety/poetry per `feedback_no_identity_jokes_content`).
- No dev jargon in user-facing humor (per `feedback_no_dev_jargon_in_readme_jokes`).
- Absolute paths if any appear.
- No UTC timestamps if any appear.

## Edge cases

- "Summarize this article" → CHAT (information delivery to Nate). Concise mode stays on.
- "Summarize this for the tweet" → COPYWRITING. Suspend.
- "Explain X" → CHAT. Always.
- "Make this sound better" → COPYWRITING.
- "Rewrite this function" → CHAT (code, not prose).
- "Rewrite this paragraph" → COPYWRITING.

**Tiebreaker:** if the output artifact will be read by humans-as-audience (not Nate-as-operator), it's copywriting.

**When in doubt:** stay in concise mode, ask one clarifying line. Better to under-suspend than over-suspend.
